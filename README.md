# DBPsMath CDN

As 3kh0 once said, "skidding gets you nothing"

# How to use
This CDN uses githack, so all you need to do is change the folder/file path.

The bare CDN path is ```https://raw.githack.com/dbpsmath/cdn/main/``` You have to add in the path, so for 2048 it would be

```
https://raw.githack.com/dbpsmath/cdn/main/2048/index.html
```
Pretty simple. If you use the CDN please star this repository
Don't give me credit, give 3kh0 credit (this is mostly games from his game ripping adventures). His CDN with more games is [here](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0-Assets)
